      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol class="counter">
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
          C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
          bring
          to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li> <br>
        <li>Directions Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice
          work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
          that it does not run off.</li> <br>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
